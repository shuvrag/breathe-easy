PM 2.5 are microscopic pollutants (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) which are a principle source of air pollution in developing countries.

This is a web-app (built using Streamlit and deployed on Heroku) to predict the PM 2.5 levels of Kolkata, India for the next 24 hours.

The model underlying the prediction is a random forest model. I also considered time series models (ARIMA) and Facebook Prophet before choosing this model.
